         * programming.
         *
         * This class is meant to help finding witness points by solving the linear
         * programming needed. As such, it contains a linear programming problem where
         * constraints can be set. This class automatically sets the simplex constraint,
         * where a found belief point needs to sum up to one.
         *
         * Optimal constraints can be progressively added as soon as found. When a
         * new constraint needs to be tested to see if a witness is available, the
         * findWitness() function can be called.
